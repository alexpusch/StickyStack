      <h2>ACT I</h2>
      <h3>SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.</h3>

      <div class='intro'>Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall</div>
      <div class='verse'>And by the doom of death end woes and all.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;</div>
      <div class='verse'>I am not partial to infringe our laws:</div>
      <div class='verse'>The enmity and discord which of late</div>
      <div class='verse'>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke</div>
      <div class='verse'>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives</div>
      <div class='verse'>Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.</div>
      <div class='verse'>For, since the mortal and intestine jars</div>
      <div class='verse'>'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</div>
      <div class='verse'>It hath in solemn synods been decreed</div>
      <div class='verse'>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</div>
      <div class='verse'>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,</div>
      <div class='verse'>If any born at Ephesus be seen</div>
      <div class='verse'>At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Again: if any Syracusian born</div>
      <div class='verse'>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</div>
      <div class='verse'>His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Unless a thousand marks be levied,</div>
      <div class='verse'>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,</div>
      <div class='verse'>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause</div>
      <div class='verse'>Why thou departed'st from thy native home</div>
      <div class='verse'>And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>A heavier task could not have been imposed</div>
      <div class='verse'>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Yet, that the world may witness that my end</div>
      <div class='verse'>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</div>
      <div class='verse'>I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.</div>
      <div class='verse'>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</div>
      <div class='verse'>Unto a woman, happy but for me,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And by me, had not our hap been bad.</div>
      <div class='verse'>With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased</div>
      <div class='verse'>By prosperous voyages I often made</div>
      <div class='verse'>To Epidamnum; till my factor's death</div>
      <div class='verse'>And the great care of goods at random left</div>
      <div class='verse'>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</div>
      <div class='verse'>From whom my absence was not six months old</div>
      <div class='verse'>Before herself, almost at fainting under</div>
      <div class='verse'>The pleasing punishment that women bear,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Had made provision for her following me</div>
      <div class='verse'>And soon and safe arrived where I was.</div>
      <div class='verse'>There had she not been long, but she became</div>
      <div class='verse'>A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</div>
      <div class='verse'>As could not be distinguish'd but by names.</div>
      <div class='verse'>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</div>
      <div class='verse'>A meaner woman was delivered</div>
      <div class='verse'>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--</div>
      <div class='verse'>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</div>
      <div class='verse'>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Made daily motions for our home return:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,</div>
      <div class='verse'>We came aboard.</div>
      <div class='verse'>A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Before the always wind-obeying deep</div>
      <div class='verse'>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</div>
      <div class='verse'>But longer did we not retain much hope;</div>
      <div class='verse'>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</div>
      <div class='verse'>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</div>
      <div class='verse'>A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</div>
      <div class='verse'>That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</div>
      <div class='verse'>And this it was, for other means was none:</div>
      <div class='verse'>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</div>
      <div class='verse'>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</div>
      <div class='verse'>To him one of the other twins was bound,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</div>
      <div class='verse'>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</div>
      <div class='verse'>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And by the benefit of his wished light,</div>
      <div class='verse'>The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered</div>
      <div class='verse'>Two ships from far making amain to us,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</div>
      <div class='verse'>But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!</div>
      <div class='verse'>Gather the sequel by that went before.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;</div>
      <div class='verse'>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</div>
      <div class='verse'>Worthily term'd them merciless to us!</div>
      <div class='verse'>For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</div>
      <div class='verse'>We were encounterd by a mighty rock;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Which being violently borne upon,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</div>
      <div class='verse'>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Fortune had left to both of us alike</div>
      <div class='verse'>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened</div>
      <div class='verse'>With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Was carried with more speed before the wind;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And in our sight they three were taken up</div>
      <div class='verse'>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</div>
      <div class='verse'>At length, another ship had seized on us;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;</div>
      <div class='verse'>That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,</div>
      <div class='verse'>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Do me the favour to dilate at full</div>
      <div class='verse'>What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</div>
      <div class='verse'>At eighteen years became inquisitive</div>
      <div class='verse'>After his brother: and importuned me</div>
      <div class='verse'>That his attendant--so his case was like,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--</div>
      <div class='verse'>Might bear him company in the quest of him:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,</div>
      <div class='verse'>I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</div>
      <div class='verse'>Or that or any place that harbours men.</div>
      <div class='verse'>But here must end the story of my life;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And happy were I in my timely death,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd</div>
      <div class='verse'>To bear the extremity of dire mishap!</div>
      <div class='verse'>Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</div>
      <div class='verse'>My soul would sue as advocate for thee.</div>
      <div class='verse'>But, though thou art adjudged to the death</div>
      <div class='verse'>And passed sentence may not be recall'd</div>
      <div class='verse'>But to our honour's great disparagement,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Yet I will favour thee in what I can.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day</div>
      <div class='verse'>To seek thy life by beneficial help:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Gaoler, take him to thy custody.</div>


      <div class='speech'>Gaoler</div>

      <div class='verse'>I will, my lord.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,</div>
      <div class='verse'>But to procrastinate his lifeless end.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Exeunt</div>

      <h3>SCENE II. The Mart.</h3>

      <div class='intro'>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant</div>


      <div class='speech'>First Merchant</div>

      <div class='verse'>Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.</div>
      <div class='verse'>This very day a Syracusian merchant</div>
      <div class='verse'>Is apprehended for arrival here;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And not being able to buy out his life</div>
      <div class='verse'>According to the statute of the town,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.</div>
      <div class='verse'>There is your money that I had to keep.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Within this hour it will be dinner-time:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And then return and sleep within mine inn,</div>
      <div class='verse'>For with long travel I am stiff and weary.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Get thee away.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Many a man would take you at your word,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And go indeed, having so good a mean.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Exit</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,</div>
      <div class='verse'>When I am dull with care and melancholy,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Lightens my humour with his merry jests.</div>
      <div class='verse'>What, will you walk with me about the town,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And then go to my inn and dine with me?</div>


      <div class='speech'>First Merchant</div>

      <div class='verse'>I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Of whom I hope to make much benefit;</div>
      <div class='verse'>I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart</div>
      <div class='verse'>And afterward consort you till bed-time:</div>
      <div class='verse'>My present business calls me from you now.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Farewell till then: I will go lose myself</div>
      <div class='verse'>And wander up and down to view the city.</div>


      <div class='speech'>First Merchant</div>

      <div class='verse'>Sir, I commend you to your own content.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Exit</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>He that commends me to mine own content</div>
      <div class='verse'>Commends me to the thing I cannot get.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I to the world am like a drop of water</div>
      <div class='verse'>That in the ocean seeks another drop,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:</div>
      <div class='verse'>So I, to find a mother and a brother,</div>
      <div class='verse'>In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</div>
      <div class='verse'>Here comes the almanac of my true date.</div>
      <div class='verse'>What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:</div>
      <div class='verse'>The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,</div>
      <div class='verse'>The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;</div>
      <div class='verse'>My mistress made it one upon my cheek:</div>
      <div class='verse'>She is so hot because the meat is cold;</div>
      <div class='verse'>The meat is cold because you come not home;</div>
      <div class='verse'>You come not home because you have no stomach;</div>
      <div class='verse'>You have no stomach having broke your fast;</div>
      <div class='verse'>But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray</div>
      <div class='verse'>Are penitent for your default to-day.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Where have you left the money that I gave you?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last</div>
      <div class='verse'>To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?</div>
      <div class='verse'>The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>I am not in a sportive humour now:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?</div>
      <div class='verse'>We being strangers here, how darest thou trust</div>
      <div class='verse'>So great a charge from thine own custody?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:</div>
      <div class='verse'>I from my mistress come to you in post;</div>
      <div class='verse'>If I return, I shall be post indeed,</div>
      <div class='verse'>For she will score your fault upon my pate.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And strike you home without a messenger.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>My charge was but to fetch you from the mart</div>
      <div class='verse'>Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:</div>
      <div class='verse'>My mistress and her sister stays for you.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours</div>
      <div class='verse'>That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I have some marks of yours upon my pate,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,</div>
      <div class='verse'>But not a thousand marks between you both.</div>

      <div class='verse'>Perchance you will not bear them patiently.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;</div>
      <div class='verse'>She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,</div>

      <div class='verse'>They say this town is full of cozenage,</div>
      <div class='verse'>As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Soul-killing witches that deform the body,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And many such-like liberties of sin:</div>
      <div class='verse'>If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:</div>
      <div class='verse'>I greatly fear my money is not safe.</div>

      <h2>ACT II</h2>
      <h3>SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.</h3>

      <div class='intro'>Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,</div>
      <div class='verse'>That in such haste I sent to seek his master!</div>
      <div class='verse'>Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Good sister, let us dine and never fret:</div>
      <div class='verse'>A man is master of his liberty:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Time is their master, and, when they see time,</div>
      <div class='verse'>They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why should their liberty than ours be more?</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Because their business still lies out o' door.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>O, know he is the bridle of your will.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>There's none but asses will be bridled so.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.</div>
      <div class='verse'>There's nothing situate under heaven's eye</div>
      <div class='verse'>But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:</div>
      <div class='verse'>The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Are their males' subjects and at their controls:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Men, more divine, the masters of all these,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Indued with intellectual sense and souls,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Are masters to their females, and their lords:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Then let your will attend on their accords.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>This servitude makes you to keep unwed.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>How if your husband start some other where?</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Till he come home again, I would forbear.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;</div>
      <div class='verse'>They can be meek that have no other cause.</div>
      <div class='verse'>A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,</div>
      <div class='verse'>We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;</div>
      <div class='verse'>But were we burdened with like weight of pain,</div>
      <div class='verse'>As much or more would we ourselves complain:</div>
      <div class='verse'>So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,</div>
      <div class='verse'>With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,</div>
      <div class='verse'>But, if thou live to see like right bereft,</div>
      <div class='verse'>This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Well, I will marry one day, but to try.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Say, is your tardy master now at hand?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears</div>
      <div class='verse'>can witness.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his</div>
      <div class='verse'>blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce</div>
      <div class='verse'>understand them.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he</div>
      <div class='verse'>hath great care to please his wife.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Horn-mad, thou villain!</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I mean not cuckold-mad;</div>
      <div class='verse'>But, sure, he is stark mad.</div>
      <div class='verse'>When I desired him to come home to dinner,</div>
      <div class='verse'>He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;</div>
      <div class='verse'>'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:</div>
      <div class='verse'>'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.</div>
      <div class='verse'>'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'</div>
      <div class='verse'>'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:</div>
      <div class='verse'>'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!</div>
      <div class='verse'>I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Quoth who?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Quoth my master:</div>
      <div class='verse'>'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'</div>
      <div class='verse'>So that my errand, due unto my tongue,</div>
      <div class='verse'>I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;</div>
      <div class='verse'>For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Go back again, and be new beaten home?</div>
      <div class='verse'>For God's sake, send some other messenger.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>And he will bless that cross with other beating:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Between you I shall have a holy head.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Am I so round with you as you with me,</div>
      <div class='verse'>That like a football you do spurn me thus?</div>
      <div class='verse'>You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:</div>
      <div class='verse'>If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Exit</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>His company must do his minions grace,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Hath homely age the alluring beauty took</div>
      <div class='verse'>From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?</div>
      <div class='verse'>If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Do their gay vestments his affections bait?</div>
      <div class='verse'>That's not my fault: he's master of my state:</div>
      <div class='verse'>What ruins are in me that can be found,</div>
      <div class='verse'>By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground</div>
      <div class='verse'>Of my defeatures. My decayed fair</div>
      <div class='verse'>A sunny look of his would soon repair</div>
      <div class='verse'>But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale</div>
      <div class='verse'>And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Or else what lets it but he would be here?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Sister, you know he promised me a chain;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Would that alone, alone he would detain,</div>
      <div class='verse'>So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!</div>
      <div class='verse'>I see the jewel best enamelled</div>
      <div class='verse'>Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,</div>
      <div class='verse'>That others touch, and often touching will</div>
      <div class='verse'>Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,</div>
      <div class='verse'>By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,</div>
      <div class='verse'>I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!</div>
      <div class='verb'>Exeunt</div>

      <h3>SCENE II. A public place.</h3>

      <div class='intro'>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse</div>


      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up</div>
      <div class='verse'>Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave</div>
      <div class='verse'>Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out</div>
      <div class='verse'>By computation and mine host's report.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I could not speak with Dromio since at first</div>
      <div class='verse'>I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Enter DROMIO of Syracuse</div>
      <div class='verse'>How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?</div>
      <div class='verse'>As you love strokes, so jest with me again.</div>
      <div class='verse'>You know no Centaur? you received no gold?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?</div>
      <div class='verse'>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,</div>
      <div class='verse'>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Even now, even here, not half an hour since.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>I did not see you since you sent me hence,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;</div>
      <div class='verse'>For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>I am glad to see you in this merry vein:</div>
      <div class='verse'>What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Beating him</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Upon what bargain do you give it me?</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Because that I familiarly sometimes</div>
      <div class='verse'>Do use you for my fool and chat with you,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Your sauciness will jest upon my love</div>
      <div class='verse'>And make a common of my serious hours.</div>
      <div class='verse'>When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,</div>
      <div class='verse'>But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.</div>
      <div class='verse'>If you will jest with me, know my aspect,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And fashion your demeanor to my looks,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Or I will beat this method in your sconce.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I</div>
      <div class='verse'>had rather have it a head: an you use these blows</div>
      <div class='verse'>long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce</div>
      <div class='verse'>it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.</div>
      <div class='verse'>But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Dost thou not know?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Shall I tell you why?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath</div>
      <div class='verse'>a wherefore.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--</div>
      <div class='verse'>For urging it the second time to me.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,</div>
      <div class='verse'>When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme</div>
      <div class='verse'>nor reason?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Well, sir, I thank you.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Thank me, sir, for what?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for</div>
      <div class='verse'>something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>In good time, sir; what's that?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Basting.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Your reason?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another</div>
      <div class='verse'>dry basting.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a</div>
      <div class='verse'>time for all things.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>By what rule, sir?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald</div>
      <div class='verse'>pate of father Time himself.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Let's hear it.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>There's no time for a man to recover his hair that</div>
      <div class='verse'>grows bald by nature.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>May he not do it by fine and recovery?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the</div>
      <div class='verse'>lost hair of another man.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,</div>
      <div class='verse'>so plentiful an excrement?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;</div>
      <div class='verse'>and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth</div>
      <div class='verse'>it in a kind of jollity.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>For what reason?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>For two; and sound ones too.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Nay, not sound, I pray you.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Sure ones, then.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Certain ones then.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Name them.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>The one, to save the money that he spends in</div>
      <div class='verse'>trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not</div>
      <div class='verse'>drop in his porridge.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair</div>
      <div class='verse'>lost by nature.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>But your reason was not substantial, why there is no</div>
      <div class='verse'>time to recover.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore</div>
      <div class='verse'>to the world's end will have bald followers.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;</div>
      <div class='verse'>I am not Adriana nor thy wife.</div>
      <div class='verse'>The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow</div>
      <div class='verse'>That never words were music to thine ear,</div>
      <div class='verse'>That never object pleasing in thine eye,</div>
      <div class='verse'>That never touch well welcome to thy hand,</div>

      <div class='verse'>For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall</div>
      <div class='verse'>A drop of water in the breaking gulf,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And take unmingled that same drop again,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Without addition or diminishing,</div>

      <div class='verse'>How dearly would it touch me to the quick,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious</div>
      <div class='verse'>And that this body, consecrate to thee,</div>

      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Villain, thou liest; for even her very words</div>

      <div class='verse'>I never spake with her in all my life.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>How can she thus then call us by our names,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Unless it be by inspiration.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>How ill agrees it with your gravity</div>
      <div class='verse'>To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!</div>
      <div class='verse'>Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,</div>

      <div class='verse'>Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Makes me with thy strength to communicate:</div>
      <div class='verse'>If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;</div>

      <div class='verse'>Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:</div>
      <div class='verse'>What, was I married to her in my dream?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?</div>
      <div class='verse'>What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Until I know this sure uncertainty,</div>

      <div class='verse'>This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!</div>

      <div class='verse'>Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,</div>
      <div class='verse'>To put the finger in the eye and weep,</div>

      <div class='verse'>Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day</div>

      <div class='verse'>Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;</div>
      <div class='verse'>My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Say that I linger'd with you at your shop</div>
      <div class='verse'>To see the making of her carcanet,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And that to-morrow you will bring it home.</div>
      <div class='verse'>But here's a villain that would face me down</div>
      <div class='verse'>He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And that I did deny my wife and house.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;</div>
      <div class='verse'>That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:</div>
      <div class='verse'>If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I think thou art an ass.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Marry, so it doth appear</div>
      <div class='verse'>By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,</div>
      <div class='verse'>You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer</div>

      <div class='verse'>O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,</div>
      <div class='verse'>A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.</div>


      <div class='speech'>BALTHAZAR</div>

      <div class='verse'>Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.</div>

      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:</div>
      <div class='verse'>But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.</div>
      <div class='verse'>But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.</div>

      <div class='verse'>[Within]  Nor to-day here you must not; come again</div>

      <div class='verse'>[Within]  The porter for this time, sir, and my name</div>
      <div class='verse'>is Dromio.</div>

      <div class='verse'>The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.</div>
      <div class='verse'>If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,</div>

      <div class='verse'>Let my master in, Luce.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCE</div>

      <div class='verse'>[Within]  Faith, no; he comes too late;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And so tell your master.</div>

      <div class='verse'>If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would</div>

      <div class='speech'>BALTHAZAR</div>

      <div class='verse'>In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.</div>

      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.</div>

      <div class='verse'>You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:</div>

      <div class='verse'>A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,</div>

      <div class='verse'>Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,</div>
      <div class='verse'>let me in.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>[Within]  Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?</div>
      <div class='verse'>For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;</div>
      <div class='verse'>If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.</div>


      <div class='speech'>BALTHAZAR</div>

      <div class='verse'>Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!</div>
      <div class='verse'>Herein you war against your reputation</div>
      <div class='verse'>And draw within the compass of suspect</div>
      <div class='verse'>The unviolated honour of your wife.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Her sober virtue, years and modesty,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:</div>
      <div class='verse'>And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse</div>
      <div class='verse'>Why at this time the doors are made against you.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Be ruled by me: depart in patience,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And about evening come yourself alone</div>
      <div class='verse'>To know the reason of this strange restraint.</div>
      <div class='verse'>If by strong hand you offer to break in</div>
      <div class='verse'>Now in the stirring passage of the day,</div>
      <div class='verse'>A vulgar comment will be made of it,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And that supposed by the common rout</div>
      <div class='verse'>Against your yet ungalled estimation</div>
      <div class='verse'>That may with foul intrusion enter in</div>
      <div class='verse'>And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;</div>
      <div class='verse'>For slander lives upon succession,</div>

      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I know a wench of excellent discourse,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:</div>
      <div class='verse'>There will we dine. This woman that I mean,</div>
      <div class='verse'>My wife--but, I protest, without desert--</div>

      <div class='verse'>To her will we to dinner.</div>
      <div class='verb'>To Angelo</div>
      <div class='verse'>Get you home</div>

      <div class='verse'>Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;</div>
      <div class='verse'>For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--</div>
      <div class='verse'>Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--</div>
      <div class='verse'>Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,</div>
      <div class='verse'>I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.</div>

      <h3>SCENE II. The same.</h3>

      <div class='intro'>Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>And may it be that you have quite forgot</div>
      <div class='verse'>A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</div>
      <div class='verse'>If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Let not my sister read it in your eye;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?</div>
      <div class='verse'>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?</div>
      <div class='verse'>'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed</div>
      <div class='verse'>And let her read it in thy looks at board:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Alas, poor women! make us but believe,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Being compact of credit, that you love us;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;</div>
      <div class='verse'>We in your motion turn and you may move us.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Then, gentle brother, get you in again;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:</div>
      <div class='verse'>'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,</div>
      <div class='verse'>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--</div>
      <div class='verse'>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</div>
      <div class='verse'>Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</div>
      <div class='verse'>The folded meaning of your words' deceit.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Against my soul's pure truth why labour you</div>
      <div class='verse'>To make it wander in an unknown field?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Are you a god? would you create me new?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.</div>
      <div class='verse'>But if that I am I, then well I know</div>
      <div class='verse'>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe</div>
      <div class='verse'>Far more, far more to you do I decline.</div>
      <div class='verse'>O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,</div>
      <div class='verse'>To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And in that glorious supposition think</div>
      <div class='verse'>He gains by death that hath such means to die:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>What, are you mad, that you do reason so?</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>It is a fault that springeth from your eye.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why call you me love? call my sister so.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Thy sister's sister.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>That's my sister.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>No;</div>
      <div class='verse'>It is thyself, mine own self's better part,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,</div>
      <div class='verse'>My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,</div>
      <div class='verse'>My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>All this my sister is, or else should be.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Give me thy hand.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>                  O, soft, air! hold you still:</div>
      <div class='verse'>I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Exit</div>
      <div class='verb'>Enter DROMIO of Syracuse</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?</div>
      <div class='verse'>am I myself?</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one</div>
      <div class='verse'>that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>What claim lays she to thee?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your</div>
      <div class='verse'>horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I</div>
      <div class='verse'>being a beast, she would have me; but that she,</div>
      <div class='verse'>being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>What is she?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may</div>
      <div class='verse'>not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have</div>
      <div class='verse'>but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a</div>
      <div class='verse'>wondrous fat marriage.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>How dost thou mean a fat marriage?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;</div>
      <div class='verse'>and I know not what use to put her to but to make a</div>
      <div class='verse'>lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I</div>
      <div class='verse'>warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a</div>
      <div class='verse'>Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,</div>
      <div class='verse'>she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>What complexion is she of?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so</div>
      <div class='verse'>clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over</div>
      <div class='verse'>shoes in the grime of it.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>That's a fault that water will mend.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>What's her name?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's</div>
      <div class='verse'>an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from</div>
      <div class='verse'>hip to hip.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Then she bears some breadth?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:</div>
      <div class='verse'>she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out</div>
      <div class='verse'>countries in her.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>In what part of her body stands Ireland?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Where Scotland?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Where France?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war</div>
      <div class='verse'>against her heir.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Where England?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no</div>
      <div class='verse'>whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,</div>
      <div class='verse'>by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Where Spain?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Where America, the Indies?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with</div>
      <div class='verse'>rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich</div>
      <div class='verse'>aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole</div>
      <div class='verse'>armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this</div>
      <div class='verse'>drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me</div>
      <div class='verse'>Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what</div>
      <div class='verse'>privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my</div>
      <div class='verse'>shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my</div>
      <div class='verse'>left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:</div>
      <div class='verse'>And, I think, if my breast had not been made of</div>
      <div class='verse'>faith and my heart of steel,</div>
      <div class='verse'>She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made</div>
      <div class='verse'>me turn i' the wheel.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Go hie thee presently, post to the road:</div>
      <div class='verse'>An if the wind blow any way from shore,</div>
      <div class='verse'>I will not harbour in this town to-night:</div>
      <div class='verse'>If any bark put forth, come to the mart,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Where I will walk till thou return to me.</div>
      <div class='verse'>If every one knows us and we know none,</div>
      <div class='verse'>'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>As from a bear a man would run for life,</div>
      <div class='verse'>So fly I from her that would be my wife.</div>

      <div class='verse'>And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.</div>
      <div class='verse'>She that doth call me husband, even my soul</div>

      <div class='verse'>Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Of such enchanting presence and discourse,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Hath almost made me traitor to myself:</div>

      <div class='verse'>That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I see a man here needs not live by shifts,</div>

      <h3>SCENE I. A public place.</h3>

      <div class='intro'>Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer</div>


      <div class='speech'>Second Merchant</div>

      <div class='verse'>You know since Pentecost the sum is due,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And since I have not much importuned you;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Nor now I had not, but that I am bound</div>
      <div class='verse'>To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Therefore make present satisfaction,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Or I'll attach you by this officer.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>Even just the sum that I do owe to you</div>
      <div class='verse'>Is growing to me by Antipholus,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And in the instant that I met with you</div>
      <div class='verse'>He had of me a chain: at five o'clock</div>
      <div class='verse'>I shall receive the money for the same.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,</div>
      <div class='verse'>I will discharge my bond and thank you too.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's</div>


      <div class='speech'>Officer</div>

      <div class='verse'>That labour may you save: see where he comes.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou</div>
      <div class='verse'>And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow</div>
      <div class='verse'>Among my wife and her confederates,</div>
      <div class='verse'>For locking me out of my doors by day.</div>
      <div class='verse'>But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.</div>

      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>A man is well holp up that trusts to you:</div>
      <div class='verse'>I promised your presence and the chain;</div>
      <div class='verse'>But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Belike you thought our love would last too long,</div>
      <div class='verse'>If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>Saving your merry humour, here's the note</div>
      <div class='verse'>How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,</div>
      <div class='verse'>The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Which doth amount to three odd ducats more</div>
      <div class='verse'>Than I stand debted to this gentleman:</div>
      <div class='verse'>I pray you, see him presently discharged,</div>
      <div class='verse'>For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I am not furnish'd with the present money;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Besides, I have some business in the town.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Good signior, take the stranger to my house</div>
      <div class='verse'>And with you take the chain and bid my wife</div>
      <div class='verse'>Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Perchance I will be there as soon as you.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Or else you may return without your money.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And I, to blame, have held him here too long.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse</div>
      <div class='verse'>Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I should have chid you for not bringing it,</div>
      <div class='verse'>But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.</div>


      <div class='speech'>Second Merchant</div>

      <div class='verse'>The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Either send the chain or send me by some token.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,</div>
      <div class='verse'>where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.</div>


      <div class='speech'>Second Merchant</div>

      <div class='verse'>My business cannot brook this dalliance.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:</div>
      <div class='verse'>If not, I'll leave him to the officer.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I answer you! what should I answer you?</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>The money that you owe me for the chain.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I owe you none till I receive the chain.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>You know I gave it you half an hour since.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Consider how it stands upon my credit.</div>


      <div class='speech'>Second Merchant</div>

      <div class='verse'>Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.</div>


      <div class='speech'>Officer</div>

      <div class='verse'>I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>This touches me in reputation.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Either consent to pay this sum for me</div>
      <div class='verse'>Or I attach you by this officer.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Consent to pay thee that I never had!</div>
      <div class='verse'>Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,</div>
      <div class='verse'>I would not spare my brother in this case,</div>
      <div class='verse'>If he should scorn me so apparently.</div>


      <div class='speech'>Officer</div>

      <div class='verse'>I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I do obey thee till I give thee bail.</div>
      <div class='verse'>But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear</div>
      <div class='verse'>As all the metal in your shop will answer.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,</div>

      <div class='verse'>The ship is in her trim; the merry wind</div>

      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,</div>
      <div class='verse'>What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;</div>

      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye</div>
      <div class='verse'>That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?</div>

      <div class='verse'>First he denied you had in him no right.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>He meant he did me none; the more my spite.</div>


      <div class='speech'>LUCIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Then swore he that he was a stranger here.</div>

      <div class='verse'>And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.</div>

      <div class='verse'>It was the copy of our conference:</div>

      <div class='verse'>Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.</div>

      <div class='verse'>It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,</div>

      <div class='verse'>Then let your servants bring my husband forth.</div>

      <div class='verse'>Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,</div>

      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>I will not hence and leave my husband here:</div>

      <div class='verse'>Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.</div>
      <div class='verse'>This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:</div>
      <div class='verse'>That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Could witness it, for he was with me then;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Where Balthazar and I did dine together.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,</div>
      <div class='verse'>I went to seek him: in the street I met him</div>
      <div class='verse'>And in his company that gentleman.</div>
      <div class='verse'>There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down</div>
      <div class='verse'>That I this day of him received the chain,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which</div>
      <div class='verse'>He did arrest me with an officer.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I did obey, and sent my peasant home</div>
      <div class='verse'>For certain ducats: he with none return'd</div>
      <div class='verse'>Then fairly I bespoke the officer</div>
      <div class='verse'>To go in person with me to my house.</div>
      <div class='verse'>By the way we met</div>
      <div class='verse'>My wife, her sister, and a rabble more</div>
      <div class='verse'>Of vile confederates. Along with them</div>
      <div class='verse'>They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,</div>
      <div class='verse'>A mere anatomy, a mountebank,</div>
      <div class='verse'>A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,</div>
      <div class='verse'>A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,</div>
      <div class='verse'>A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together</div>
      <div class='verse'>They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence</div>
      <div class='verse'>And in a dark and dankish vault at home</div>
      <div class='verse'>There left me and my man, both bound together;</div>
      <div class='verse'>Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,</div>
      <div class='verse'>I gain'd my freedom, and immediately</div>
      <div class='verse'>Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech</div>
      <div class='verse'>To give me ample satisfaction</div>
      <div class='verse'>For these deep shames and great indignities.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,</div>
      <div class='verse'>That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>But had he such a chain of thee or no?</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANGELO</div>

      <div class='verse'>He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,</div>
      <div class='verse'>These people saw the chain about his neck.</div>


      <div class='speech'>Second Merchant</div>

      <div class='verse'>Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine</div>
      <div class='verse'>Heard you confess you had the chain of him</div>
      <div class='verse'>After you first forswore it on the mart:</div>
      <div class='verse'>And thereupon I drew my sword on you;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And then you fled into this abbey here,</div>
      <div class='verse'>From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I never came within these abbey-walls,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:</div>
      <div class='verse'>I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!</div>
      <div class='verse'>And this is false you burden me withal.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why, what an intricate impeach is this!</div>
      <div class='verse'>I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.</div>
      <div class='verse'>If here you housed him, here he would have been;</div>
      <div class='verse'>If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:</div>
      <div class='verse'>You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here</div>
      <div class='verse'>Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.</div>


      <div class='speech'>Courtezan</div>

      <div class='verse'>He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?</div>


      <div class='speech'>Courtezan</div>

      <div class='verse'>As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I think you are all mated or stark mad.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Exit one to Abbess</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Haply I see a friend will save my life</div>
      <div class='verse'>And pay the sum that may deliver me.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?</div>
      <div class='verse'>And is not that your bondman, Dromio?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Within this hour I was his bondman sir,</div>
      <div class='verse'>But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:</div>
      <div class='verse'>Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>I am sure you both of you remember me.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;</div>
      <div class='verse'>For lately we were bound, as you are now</div>
      <div class='verse'>You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why look you strange on me? you know me well.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I never saw you in my life till now.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And careful hours with time's deformed hand</div>
      <div class='verse'>Have written strange defeatures in my face:</div>
      <div class='verse'>But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Neither.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>Dromio, nor thou?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>                  No, trust me, sir, nor I.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>I am sure thou dost.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a</div>
      <div class='verse'>man denies, you are now bound to believe him.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>Not know my voice! O time's extremity,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue</div>
      <div class='verse'>In seven short years, that here my only son</div>
      <div class='verse'>Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?</div>
      <div class='verse'>Though now this grained face of mine be hid</div>
      <div class='verse'>In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And all the conduits of my blood froze up,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Yet hath my night of life some memory,</div>
      <div class='verse'>My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,</div>
      <div class='verse'>My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:</div>
      <div class='verse'>All these old witnesses--I cannot err--</div>
      <div class='verse'>Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I never saw my father in my life.</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>The duke and all that know me in the city</div>
      <div class='verse'>Can witness with me that it is not so</div>
      <div class='verse'>I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years</div>
      <div class='verse'>Have I been patron to Antipholus,</div>
      <div class='verse'>During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:</div>
      <div class='verse'>I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.</div>
      <div class='verb'>Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse</div>

      <div class='verb'>All gather to see them</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>One of these men is Genius to the other;</div>
      <div class='verse'>And so of these. Which is the natural man,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And which the spirit? who deciphers them?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?</div>


      <div class='speech'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>O, my old master! who hath bound him here?</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEMELIA</div>

      <div class='verse'>Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds</div>
      <div class='verse'>And gain a husband by his liberty.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man</div>
      <div class='verse'>That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia</div>
      <div class='verse'>That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:</div>
      <div class='verse'>O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And speak unto the same AEmilia!</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEGEON</div>

      <div class='verse'>If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:</div>
      <div class='verse'>If thou art she, tell me where is that son</div>
      <div class='verse'>That floated with thee on the fatal raft?</div>


      <div class='speech'>AEMELIA</div>

      <div class='verse'>By men of Epidamnum he and I</div>
      <div class='verse'>And the twin Dromio all were taken up;</div>
      <div class='verse'>But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth</div>
      <div class='verse'>By force took Dromio and my son from them</div>
      <div class='verse'>And me they left with those of Epidamnum.</div>
      <div class='verse'>What then became of them I cannot tell</div>
      <div class='verse'>I to this fortune that you see me in.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Why, here begins his morning story right;</div>
      <div class='verse'>These two Antipholuses, these two so like,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--</div>
      <div class='verse'>Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--</div>
      <div class='verse'>These are the parents to these children,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Which accidentally are met together.</div>
      <div class='verse'>Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.</div>


      <div class='speech'>DUKE SOLINUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF EPHESUS</div>

      <div class='verse'>I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--</div>

      <div class='verse'>No; I say nay to that.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>And so do I; yet did she call me so:</div>
      <div class='verse'>And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,</div>
      <div class='verse'>Did call me brother.</div>

      <div class='verse'>I think I did, sir; I deny it not.</div>


      <div class='speech'>ADRIANA</div>

      <div class='verse'>I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,</div>

      <div class='verse'>No, none by me.</div>
      <div class='verse'>ANTIPHOLUS</div>


      <div class='speech'>OF SYRACUSE</div>

      <div class='verse'>This purse of ducats I received from you,</div>
      <div class='verse'>And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.</div>
      <div class='verse'>I see we still did meet each other's man,</div>
